# FSGoogleMaps #
This is the code for my blog post entitled "[Streaming aircraft position from FSX to Google Maps with Realtime](http://www.sergiocosta.me/streaming-aircraft-position-from-fsx-to-google-maps-with-realtime)".

You can see a video for this application at [YouTube](http://youtu.be/4engZ-fvNkU).

This repository is comprised of 2 different applications:

- FSGoogleMaps: The main application which acts as a proxy between ORTC (Open Realtime Connectivity) and FSX (Microsoft Flight Simulator X)
- GoogleMapsPage: a webpage that displays Google Maps and the FSGoogleMaps user's aircraft location and heading

By using these apps together you should be able to see your aircraft displayed on Google Maps. If you have a friend (or several friends) using this app, you will see everyone displayed on the map. Just note that all the FSGoogleMaps applications need to work with the same Realtime.co application key (get your for free at [www.realtime.co](http://www.realtime.co)).

I hope you enjoy the post and the example. If you have any questions, doubts, corrections or ideas, please feel free to drop by my blog and contact me.
